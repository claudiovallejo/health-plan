# Personal Health Plan
## by Claudio Vallejo

I've attempted to stay organized when it comes to eating well and staying active. Food journals, exercise journals, book meal plans, training routines... I've tried many things over the years and while I've learned a lot about what eating healthy means and know the basics of bodybuilding, I've yet to find a way to feel in control of my health.

I just moved to a new city and would like to cook my own meals to save money and to eat as healthy as possible. In attempting to determine what and how much food to buy on Sundays, I decided to take things a bit more seriously and learn more about healthy eating, bodybuilding, and eating/exercise journaling.

I am not sure what the end result of my research will be but my goal of conducting this research and logging daily food intake and exercise routines is to find a process or system that enables me to stay organized and in control of my health.
