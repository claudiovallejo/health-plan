**Note:**
*I don't usually run in the mornings, but I had some issues with gym registration so I was kicked out of the gym this morning. Hopefully I can register today and start the gym routines tomorrow.*

**Note:**
*I'm still in the process of adding my name to the gym's system. I did a brief Google search and found there are a variety of 'outdoor gyms' in multiple public parks throughout the city. I will be going to Columbus Park, which is approximately 1.1 miles from my place and will be doing an outdoor workout with the available equipment.*
